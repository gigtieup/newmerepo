    "Object-oriented programming relies heavily on the concepts of classes and objects. A class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects, defining their properties and methods, and serving as a design model for creating instances of the object. In contrast, an object is an instantiation of a class, possessing unique properties and methods. The utilization of classes and objects allows for a structured and organized method of creating and utilizing real-world objects and concepts in code, such as cars, animals, and bank accounts. It is crucial to understand the distinctions and functions of classes and objects in order to effectively implement and utilize object-oriented programming techniques in software development."
