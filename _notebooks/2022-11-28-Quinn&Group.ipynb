Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length <275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem.\n",

Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that \"mathematics is not yet ready for such problems\" (Lagarias 1985).\n",

Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666).

In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA's speed of light)."

    "## What is Algorithm Efficiency? \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic efficiency is an aspect of algorithmic programming that measures the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other."

    "In the last section, we were talking about a sorting algorithm and we discussed two ways that we could sort the numbers in the order from least to greatest. The reason the second one ran faster than the first one is because scanning all of them is quicker than scanning one by one. An algorithm’s efficiency is determined through formal or mathematical reasoning. My reasoning was more formal than mathematical."
