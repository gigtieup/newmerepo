# My quiz plan:
 
- 0. Create a quiz similar to the example
(Just to get a feel for the program)
- 1. Brainstorm
(How to make my website/ function stand out)
- 2. Create
(Use what I know from building the original quiz and the brainstorm plan to create what website I had in mind)
- 3. Check/ Ask
(Ask teacher and classmates if anything needs to be added or changed)
 
# Drafting:
 
-for my code I used a simple repeating command "on event ("Button name","click", function(){"
    (what this did was basically set the command for a button to take you to a separate page)
    
# Data Abstraction
 
An example of Data Abstraction in this program is the "font size" chart. It holds multiple selections that represent different sizes. A random number function takes a random size selection from the list and sets the default font size to that selection.
 
# The point
 The point of the assignment was to get comfortable with code.org but spacificaly java script commands
