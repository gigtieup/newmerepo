- We are going to create a website that simulates a real online website that you can shop on
- We want to create different products with different prices
- We also want the website to have all of the basics that normal websites have
- On our website we want to create a calculator, so when you add something to your cart a price will be calculated
- When you check out we are going to add a 7.75% tax to the total because that is the sales tax in San Diego
- We are going to have a flat price added to the total to represent the cost of shipping
