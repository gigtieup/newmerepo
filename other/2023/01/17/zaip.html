<p>Discrepencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only difference between my scores and college board scoring is the program purpose and function category. What I learned is that there must be a line between purpose and function because it is hard for me to differentiate and check if both are present.</li>
</ul>
<p>How my project can meet standards(How am I going to use these lessons?):</p>
<ul>
<li>From this submission, I learned that there must be a distinct difference betweem the purpose and function of the program. I also know to implement detailed explanations when describing my program because the code without the evidence is not enough to show understanding.</li>

<p>Discrepencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were not any differences or confusions with this example because all the pieces were clear to see and understand. I could point out each part and what criteria it met, so I gave everything full credit just like what it earned from college board.</li>
</ul>
<p>How my project can meet standards(How am I going to use these lessons?):</p>
<ul>
<li>One thing I took away from this sample that I can use for my future work is how they explained their procedure and code with a lot of detail. It showed me a good example of how to explain in order to show full understanding. I also learned that explanations of each section will go very far so I will implement that when creating my program.</li>

<p>Discrepencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>I also didn't have any discrepencies for this sample either. Similarly to the last one, this was very good for the most part especially in terms of how specific and completed this was. Besides the missed purpose, the code was clear and well done so it was simple to grade by criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p>How my project can meet standards(How am I going to use these lessons?):</p>
<ul>
<li>I am going to use what I learned to meet the standards with my own project by looking to make sure that the code isn't only completed, but also explained. Also, when we do explain it, we should be criteria specific to make sure we define what college board wants us to.</li>

</h3>
<p>Discrepencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a different score than college board for data abstraction because I misunderstood the purpose of the code. The code, in reality, did not exactly apply or impact the program which is the whole point. I also didn't give the student a 0 for testing because I noticed the conditions are being tested. I overlooked the arguments of the execution of the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>How my project can meet standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am going to use this to meet the standards when creating my program by coming up with a specific code segment that will earn the data abstraction point becuase the list will directly relate the the purpose of the program I described for the first point. I will also make sure all parts are included in terms of testing.</li>
